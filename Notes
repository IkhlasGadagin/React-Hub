What is React ?? React is a JavaScript Library used to create Web Applicationns then how to write the code in the html firstly we have to create 
the div tag the the .html File secondly we have to paste the link of Core React and ReactDOM files in the body of our program
we have to write the react code in the Script tag therefore create seperate App.js file then link it ...then how to do print the Heading in the 
Page for this we have to call createElemen fumction and the has 3 parameters (the name of the tag,Object[may contain id],child, data that need to display),, this causes the problem while we have multiple inner tags like div tag..AND if we have siblings use array via through the child after 
the second parameter  and it arraies the ERROR because it needs ti be unique key ...BUT but it seems more complecited threfore the JSX came into existience ..Write more about the render fumction
